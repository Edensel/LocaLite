# The LocaLite Country App Finder

![Design preview for the LocaLite Country App Finder]()

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out the LocaLite Country App Finder, a front-end coding challenge project.

Frontend Mentor challenges are designed to help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.



## The Challenge

Your task is to build a web application that allows users to search for countries, filter them by region, and view detailed information about a specific country. You'll integrate with the REST Countries API to fetch country data and display it in a user-friendly way.

The challenge also provides designs for both light and dark modes, allowing you to implement a theme switcher for the app.

### Key Features

- Search for countries by name.
- Filter countries by region.
- View detailed information about a specific country, including its name, population, region, subregion, capital, top-level domain, currencies, and languages.
- Toggle between light and dark themes (optional).

## Where to Find Everything

The project provides you with the following files and resources:

- `index.html`: The HTML file where you'll structure the content of your web app.
- `index.js`: The JavaScript file for implementing the app's functionality.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling your web app.
- `design`: A folder containing design images for both light and dark modes.

## Building Your Project

You have complete control over how you structure your project and implement the features. Here's a suggested process to follow:

1. Set up a new GitHub repository for your project.
2. Create the HTML structure in `index.html`.
3. Write the basic styles in `style.css`.
4. Implement the core functionality using JavaScript in `index.js`.

### REST Countries API

To fetch data from the REST Countries API, you will make HTTP requests using JavaScript. You'll need to use JavaScript to fetch data and display it in your web app.
