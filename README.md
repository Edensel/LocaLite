## Where to Find Everything

The project provides you with the following files and resources:

- `index.js`: The JavaScript file for implementing the app's functionality.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling your web app.

## Building Your Project

You have complete control over how you structure your project and implement the features. Here's a suggested process to follow:

1. Set up a new GitHub repository for your project.
2. Create the HTML structure in `index.html`.
3. Write the basic styles in `style.css`.
4. Implement the core functionality using JavaScript in `index.js`.

### REST Countries API
